# Notes for everyone
I belive notes should be for everyone; this simple project is a note-taking website, built with hono and front-end basics.
You can publish the project on Cloudflare with a KV namespace.

For devs:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

To have your own version:
```
npm run deploy
```

## Roadmap
- Add markdown (Marked.js) support (ongoing).
- Drag and drop imports.
- Mobile version.
