# Notes for everyone
I belive notes should be for everyone; this simple project is a note-taking website, built with hono and simple front-end techs.
You can publish the project on Cloudflare with a KV connected.
I am planning to add markdown support soon (as the name suggest).

For devs:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
To have your own version:
```
npm run deploy
```
